Extract the following data from the given context, in a structured dictionary-like output:
- EBITDA: the most recent value for the EBITDA, as a number. nothing else, just the full number, without any currency signs, dots or commas. ex.: if latest EBITDA is $ 20bi, just answer '20000000000'. your answer has to be an integer, no strings.,
- Last year of data: the latest year available in the EBITDA data, as a number (ex.: 2018).
- Currency: the currency of the financial data, using ISO 4217. ex.: USD, EUR, GBP, etc.

Here's an example of the expected output:
{
    "EBITDA":1000000000,
    "Last year of data":2010,
    "Currency":"USD",
}

Just answer in that format, between curly braces, nothing else (don't format it)
